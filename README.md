# Flanged Conical Support Pedestal — Autodesk Inventor CAD Model

## 📖 Overview
This project models a flanged conical support pedestal with square base and central cylindrical protrusion, fully created in Autodesk Inventor. The component demonstrates key Inventor workflows: sketch-based extrusion, revolve for cylindrical and conical features, patterned holes, large fillet transitions, and precise dimension-driven modeling from an engineering drawing.

## 🎯 Objective
Accurately recreate the support pedestal from the provided technical drawing while ensuring clean, parametric, manufacture-ready geometry suitable for machining, casting or 3D printing. Commonly used as an elevated base for pipes, shafts, rods or machinery components.

## 🏭Manufacturing Considerations

Recommended methods:
- CNC machining (aluminum/steel)  
- Sand/investment casting + finish machining  
- 3D printing (prototypes)  

Supports:  
- M10–M12 bolts through Ø12 mm holes  
- Large R20 fillets for stress relief & deburring  

## 🌐 Applications
- Pipe/tube support stands  
- Shaft/rod pedestals  
- Machinery alignment bases  
- Equipment mounting supports  

## 💭 Reflection
This Inventor project demonstrated:

- Interpreting multiview drawings  
- Revolve & extrusion for cylindrical/conical geometry  
- Fully constrained parametric sketches  
- Large fillets for production-ready parts  
- Clean model for drawings/assemblies/CAM  

Possible enhancements:  
- Add bolt features  
- Create annotated drawing sheet  
- Assign material & mass  
- Basic stress simulation  
- Small assembly with sample component
